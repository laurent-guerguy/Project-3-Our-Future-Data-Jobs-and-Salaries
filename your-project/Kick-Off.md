## Project Description  
In this project, you will choose a topic and find all the relevant data yourself. This means you can connect to an API, find a dataset or scrape data from the web. You then must organize, clean and analyse the data you find and present your findings in a presentation (you may use plots!) and a paper.  

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals  
* Learn how to develop an interesting question and find the data to answer it.
* Learn how to obtain data from different sources, including APIs, open source datasets and/or scrape data from the web.
* Build a database from the data you find for the whole team to use.
* Explain more complex arguments with plots.  

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/26Wr3pVF/project-3-data-thief).
* You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned.
* Create a *.gitignore* file and include it in your repository. 
* The only tool you can use to plot is Zeppelin.  
* Your project must include data from at least 2 different data sources (APIs & web, dataset & APIs, ...)

<a name="deliverables"></a>

## Deliverables  
You are required to turn in the following:  
1. Link to your repository with your code, Zeppelin JSON (details below) and README.
2. Access information to your database in Google Cloud with a description of each table and how they relate.  
3. Links to the data you are using (sources) and your organization (trello).  
4. Slides for your presentation (template provided).  

<a name="mentoring"></a>

## Mentoring
One of the TAs will be your mentor!
Your mentor will:
* Follow your project in general, will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following the tasks, your blockers, etc
* Help/support you in specific questions.

Your mentor is not meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be the responsible person to do the tasks!

<a name="schedule"></a>

## Schedule  
*Thursday*
* Look for an interesting topic and make some hypothesis or think about some questions to answer about it. 
* Investigate which data sources are available for that topic.
* Reach some best practices agreements as a team.

*Friday*
* Plan your project and organize. Think some risks you can have.
* Start working on your database. 

*Monday*
* Be ready for the database validation with the Lead Teacher and TAs.
* Start working on your analysis and plots. Think about the plots you want to create and the structure of your paper. 

*Wednesday*
* Start working on your presentation. 

*Thursday*
* Finish your analysis and presentation.

*Friday*
* Presentation!

<a name="json-structure"></a>

## Json structure
No plots outside a sql cell!  
The json will be your paper and it is meant to have all the (analysis) information about your project.

The structure should be:
1. Title of the project
2. Introduction to your project.
3. Data you are using (and comments, main challenges, strengths & weaknesses, etc...)
4. Questions you want to answer (maybe divided by different topics). Each question should include a graph and a conclusion written in a markdown cell.
5. Conclusions after your analysis.
6. Further questions.

You can find some paper examples in the ```Resources``` section. 

<a name="presentation"></a>

## Presentation
You will have 10 minutes to present your project. The below are some ideas for slides you could include in your presentation; those marked with an **(M)** are mandatory! 

* **(M)** Title of the project
* **(M)** Your topic. Why did you choose it?
* **(M)** Presentation of the team
* Main challenges & strengths
* **(M)** Team. Did you follow your workflow plan? Did you add something after starting the project? Did you follow your best practices agreements? Did you think about the risk management?
* About your data: useful sources, incomplete data, data that would have been great to have, etc. 
* Data cleaning: how and why you cleaned your data the way you did.
* **(M)** Main insights: one slide per insight!
* Questions you couldn't answer. 
* Something funny that happened during the project. 
* Things you learned during this project.
* If you could start from scratch, what would you do differently?

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks  
* First, choose your topic and look for sources available.
* Before you start coding and integrate more data, propose some interesting questions you could answer with the data you have.
