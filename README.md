## Project Description
Data is information, and as long as it is relevant, it’s a tool to study the past, so we can look into the future. So, what else can we do but to try discovering ours? And that’s what’s this project is all about, looking for available roles in different countries and comparing them with each other in order to get the most profitable (even in a non economical sense) option

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
-USA will have the greatest salaries, but not so much life quality
-Spain will have the lowest salaries, but great life quality
-France and UK will be average, higher salaries than in Spain, but less happiness too
-Germany will have both; life quality and high salaries

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The data has been selected among different platforms such as Glassdoor (using web scraping to collect the data of average salaries) and Numbeo for the cost of living https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/)

## Workflow
First of all, it is necessary to have a clear mind, to know what to do, and after that, start planning about it. 
Once we have finished the planning, we divide the work by the capacities of each member so we all can work in something we are good at. 
Then, communicating is essential: you can’t work without your team, so even if you have stuff to do on your own, you need to know the work of the team and interact with it, giving feedback and contributing.

## Organization
Our method was simple: Communication. You need nothing but interaction with all the members of the team to get it done, you just need to understand your role in the team and the work and once you do just go on. 
Of course, we did use tools to get things more friendly, as the board to explain and agree and Trello to remember those decisions.
